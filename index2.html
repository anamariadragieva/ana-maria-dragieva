                <h2>About</h2>
                <p>
                    As a career-changer transitioning into software development, I bring a unique 
                    combination of analytical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving to my work. 
                    I specialise in backend development with Python, Flask, Django, and SQL, with a 
                    growing focus on FinTech and data-driven applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After completing a Software Engineering Bootcamp at HyperionDev, I have gained 
                    hands-on experience in building web applications, integrating APIs, and managing 
                    databases. Through my freelance work, I have developed financial tools such as 
                    expense trackers, business forecasting applications, and automation solutions, 
                    combining my eye for detail with strong technical expertise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Previously, in my role as Assistant Manager at SageBrown, I leveraged data 
                    analytics to optimise inventory and sales forecasting while leading a team and 
                    improving bespoke order processes. My experience in business strategy, pricing, 
                    and client relations enhances my ability to develop software that solves real-world 
                    business problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My background in design makes me a problem-solver who enjoys crafting efficient, 
                    user-friendly applications. I'm particularly interested in FinTech, where I can 
                    apply my coding skills to develop scalable financial tools, automation solutions, 
                    and data-driven applications.
                </p>
